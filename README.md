# Variable Gait with Push Recovery

In this project, the 1D Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) of a biped was controlled by a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with a variable velocity gait. By tracking the Instantaneous Capture Point, it was possible to also implement push recovery to the model. The model, and the observations are explained in better detail in the [Report](https://github.com/thathvik/2D-LIPM_Variable_Gait_MPC/blob/master/Report.pdf).

This is the final project submitted for the course *Optimal and Learning Control* (ME-GY 7973), as done by Tarun Thathvik Paladugu. This project expands on the previous work on [Model Predictive Control](https://github.com/thathvik/optlearningcontrol/blob/master/Series3/Series_3_exercise_1.ipynb) of the LIPM in the Exercise Series 3. The instructions to run/modify the variables are given in the [Notebook file](https://github.com/thathvik/2D-LIPM_Variable_Gait_MPC/blob/master/Final_Project.ipynb).
